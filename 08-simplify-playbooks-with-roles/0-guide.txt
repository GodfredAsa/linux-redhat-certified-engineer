The reason why tasks was not included in the yml files was that its placed in a task directory in the VM.

After creating the yml files based in the tasks directory under the roles/basicinstall/tasks/main.yml 

we create a playbook to use those files in the playbooks directory in the ansible playbooks directory 

NB: Although here the individual files are not named main.yml in practice should be named main.yml as directed in the attached pdf.
