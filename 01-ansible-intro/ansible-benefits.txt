HOW ANSIBLE WORKS 
• Each specific task in ansible is written through a module.
• Multiple Modules are written in sequential order
• Multiple Modules for related Tasks is called a Play
• All Plays together makes a Playbook
• Playbook is written in YAML format or syntax

NOTE: The host dir  /etc/ansible/hosts thats where most of the remote clients Inventory resides 

Terminologies 
• Control node or Ansible Server
• Server which runs Ansible application
• Modules
• Module is a command meant to be executed on the client-side
• Most of the IT tasks modules are already created and can be found on Ansible website
 www.docs.ansible.com and www.galaxy.ansible.com → search for module index
• Example of modules:
    1. Install http         ----|
    2. Enable http service      |---->  task
    3. Start http service   ----|

Task
• A task is a section that consists of a single procedure to be completed. A task can have multiple modules

• Playbook: Automation file with step-by-step execution of multiple tasks
• YAML: A Playbook written in YAML language (Yet another markup language)

• Inventory: File that has information about remote clients where tasks are executed
• Tag: reference or alias to a specific task
• Variable: holds the defined value which can be used repetitively
• Role
• Splitting of Playbook into smaller groups. Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users
