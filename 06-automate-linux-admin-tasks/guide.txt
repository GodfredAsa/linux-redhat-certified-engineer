Imagine you have to create a user in 100 linux machines of VM
Would you likely login to all the VMs and manually create the users or 
automate the process rather.
Login into all the 100 machines to create the user is unproductive 

Checking if a user exists in our VM

id userName

Example: id vagrant 
View Lists of users: cat /etc/passwd
Search Format in Linux: grep vagrant /etc/passwd
Login as created user george: ssh myuser@vm_ip_address, then enter the password.
