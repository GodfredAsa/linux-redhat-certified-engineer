### KEY USAGE OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANSIBLE 
Ansible is a powerful automation tool used for various purposes in IT environments, including:

1. ** Configuration Management**: Ansible allows for the automation of configuration tasks across multiple servers or devices, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors. It can manage configurations for systems, applications, network devices, and more.

2. **Application Deployment**: Ansible streamlines the deployment of applications by automating tasks such as installing dependencies, configuring settings, and deploying code across servers or environments.

3. **Orchestration**: Ansible can orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple systems or services, coordinating tasks and ensuring they are executed in the correct order and with the desired outcome.

4. **Provisioning**: Ansible automates the process of provisioning new infrastructure or virtual machines, allowing for rapid and consistent deployment of resources.

5. **Continuous Delivery**: Ansible facilitates continuous delivery practices by automating tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software, enabling faster and more reliable software releases.

6. **Security Compliance**: Ansible can enforce security policies and compliance standards by automating tasks such as vulnerability assessments, system hardening, and configuration auditing.

7. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Ansible enables the definition of infrastructure configurations as code, allowing for version control, repeatability, and scalability of infrastructure provisioning and management.

Overall, Ansible simplifies and accelerates IT operations by automating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, reducing errors, and enhancing scalability and reliability in various IT environments.
